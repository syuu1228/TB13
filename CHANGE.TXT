- Support for PCI bridges does not work right.

A386 BUGS (version 4.05):

- low(forward defined) not filled in correctly.

- use32 causes offset 16 to be clobbered. STARTOFS should be > 0.

HISTORY:

This covers core changes only, not chipsets / board ports.
Refer to respective source files for details on those.

pd 010214	KBD	change reset jump to F000:FFF0 -> fixes AMD Elan SC520
			Ctrl-Alt-Del restart.

pd 010207	KBD	skip keyboard init if NO_KBC option set, KBC not
			present.

pd 010126	all	Ported to A386 assembler.

pd 000816	KBD	Fixed putbuf overrun prevention.

pd 000815	EQU	Changed from double use of m_vpal, m_vmsel to
		VID	m_console, m_conkey (unused floppy bytes)
		
		COM	Disable 2400 baud mode (set by DOS during bootup)
			if CONSOLE set.

pd 000424	POST2	Add option QUICKMEM -> memory size and clear only.

pd 000211	HDD	Added support for new SanDisk CompactFlash cards.

pd 991127	EQU	Added variables for PS/2 mouse.
		INT1X	Added hooks for PS/2 mouse.
		PS2MOUS Added PS/2 mouse support.
		COM	Fixed m_devflg handling.
		SIO_NONE Moved to SIO directory.
		SMC*	Moved to SIO directory.
	
pd 991115 	PCIPNP	fix PCI I/O allocation: some devices (e.g. ESS Tech)
			have 16 bit base registers.

pd 991020/21 	DATA	Add hd_top.
		HDD	Add hd_top, needed to support M-Systems DiskOnChip.
		POST	Add option for M-Systems DiskOnChip.

pd 991003 	LPT	Fixed lp_test loop.
		
pd 990603	POST 	Changed to RET_SP macro.

			Abandoned CYRIXGX mode in assembler (inconsistent
			op codes depending on version).
			Source for assembler is now available in PASM
			directory.
			
		POST	Added POST code and call for cs_cache
			if present (needs to be moved from decide routine).
			Added return label for cs_init, cs_det, allows
			return by JMP rather than RET.
		
		FILL16	Changed from .COM to .BIN extension.
		
		FILL32	Changed from .COM to .BIN extension.

pd 990525	PCI	Rewrote 32 bit PCI BIOS to fix Linux problem.
